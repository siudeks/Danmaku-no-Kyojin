## Coordinate system

In Danmaku.Lib we use [Cartesian coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system)

		         ^
		 (-1,1)  |  (1,1)
		         |      
		 ------- 0 ----->
		         |
		 (-1,-1) |  (1,-1)
		      

It is a different coordinate system approach compared to Monogame. As the result, we need to d orecalculations between Danmaku and Monogame coordinate systems.
