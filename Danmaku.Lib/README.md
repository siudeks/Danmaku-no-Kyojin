## Coordinate system

In Danmaki.Lib we use [Cartesian coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system)

		         ^
		 (-1,1)  |  (1,1)
		         |      
		 ------- 0 ----->
		         |
		 (-1,-1) |  (1,-1)
		      

It is a different approach compared to XNA/Monogame where it uses different calculations. As result, we need to recalculate when needed
values from game coordinates to apply XNA/Monogame rules.
